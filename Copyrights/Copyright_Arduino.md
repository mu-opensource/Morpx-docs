## Arduino

- Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP). The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source IDE can be downloaded for free at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

- Arduino is an open source project, supported by many.
The Arduino team is composed of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe and David A. Mellis.
Arduino uses GNU avr-gcc toolchain, GCC ARM Embedded toolchain, avr-libc, avrdude, bossac, openOCD and code from Processing and Wiring.
