## Arduino

- Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. 
Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP). 
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source IDE can be downloaded for free at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

- Arduino is an open source project, supported by many.
The Arduino team is composed of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe and David A. Mellis.
Arduino uses GNU avr-gcc toolchain, GCC ARM Embedded toolchain, avr-libc, avrdude, bossac, openOCD and code from Processing and Wiring.

## MicroPython

- MicroPython is written in C99 and the entire MicroPython core is available for general use under the very liberal MIT license. 
Most libraries and extension modules (some of which are from a third party) are also available under MIT or similar licenses.

- You can freely use and adapt MicroPython for personal use, in education, and in commercial products.

- MicroPython is developed in the open on GitHub and the source code is available at the GitHub page, and on the download page. 
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project.
